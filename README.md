#Student Management System with MySQL and API
Overview
A full-fledged Student Management System where users can manage student records using an API. This system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data stored in a MySQL database. The application consists of a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js, and the frontend communicates with the API to manage the data.

Features
CRUD Operations:
Create: Add new student records to the database.
Read: Retrieve and display student records.
Update: Edit existing student records.
Delete: Remove student records from the database.
API Endpoints: A set of RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD operations.
Frontend Interface: A simple user interface to interact with the backend API and manage student data.
#Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (Fetch API for API communication)
Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
MySQL
RESTful API
Database:
MySQL (for storing student data)
Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
MySQL (v5.7 or higher)
Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-api.git
Install backend dependencies: Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd student-management-api
npm install
Set up MySQL database:

Create a new MySQL database (e.g., student_management).
Inside the project folder, you’ll find a SQL file database/setup.sql. Run this file in your MySQL server to set up the required tables.
Example command in MySQL:
bash
Copy
source path/to/setup.sql;
Configure the database connection:

In the config/database.js file, update the database credentials with your own (username, password, and database name).
Start the server: After setting up the database, start the backend server:

sql
Copy
npm start
The server will now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Access the application:

Open the frontend files in your browser (index.html or a custom frontend you’ve built) and start interacting with the application.
Use the API to add, view, update, and delete student records.
API Endpoints
GET /students: Fetch all student records.
GET /students/:id: Fetch a specific student by ID.
POST /students: Add a new student record.
PUT /students/:id: Update an existing student record by ID.
DELETE /students/:id: Delete a student record by ID.
